# MCP Variants (Draft Extension)

This repository provides a multi-language reference implementation of the variants proposal for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), as described in [SEP-2053](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2053).

> #### **Status:** Experimental. This work is for prototyping and feedback only, and is not an accepted or official MCP extension.
